This time I am serious.

Not wishing to lose hope, I did started trying to meet more people for
opportunity. I started a number file on my mac, so it looks more like a
project than improvising.

Keeping busy, for any reason, can be a relief, since at least the man is
moving towards hope.

I will be more than happy to keep working on healthcare, focusing on
innovation to provide better product/service. However if by all means I cannot
find a proper company to join, I might detour to other functions like roles
invlocing international business or other market positions in tech companies.

Wish me luck.
