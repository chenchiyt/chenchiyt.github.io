How can I better my chance of getting a "offer" for graduate school?

Q:

I major in veterinary medicine in China, and I plan to further my study in the
US.  
The fact is a Chinese bachelor's degree for vet is not granted for programs
like DVM, or clinical ones, so I decide to start from research program.  
I'm starting my application next summer, and I want to know what else can I do
to make me more competitive.  
MY CONDITION:I've finished GRE and scored 1300+3.5, not yet Toefl. I have a
strong interest in Photography and do pretty well an amateur. I'm now working
and learning in lab for skills and trying to complete my own paper. What I
worry is last term my scores are not so good(average a little more than 80 out
of 100).  
  
Your suggestion will help me a lot!

A:

Research programs will care largely on your GPA, undergrad research, and
letters of recommendations from professors. Undergrad research is extremely
important because that's what academic grad programs are all about. So if you
haven't done that, make sure to do so before you graduate as once you graduate
it becomes difficult to backtrack on this. If you can get yourself published
in a journal then that's just wonderful. Having your professors write you a
letter of recommendation will be straight forward once you got your research
in place. GPA is important, I'm not sure what you have in equivalent but an
80% rating is equal to a B- letter grade and that is not impressive at all for
grad school admissions. You should raise that higher to around 87-90%, around
A- level, so try to study harder.
