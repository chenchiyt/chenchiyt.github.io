Sorry I have to write in English again, because I am too lazy to bring my own
laptop now. On the one hand it's heavy, not healthy for either me or my
backpack, which is already so worn and funky, on the other hand it's kind of
affected by some virus or I don't know, maybe trash, so it's running
incredibly slow. I don't want to carry a heavy thing which cost me 10 minutes
to open and start to power off 30 mins without power outlet. I know it's not
time for a new one, so I gotta find a time to fix it, damn it, another
mission.  
  
I am not like what I used to be in college now. Back in college, I could spend
the whole afternoon rebuilding the system, which I wish it could crash as
often as possible, so that I don't get bored. See how much time we have wasted
back then.  
  
I would argue to myself: hey shut up man, you got brothers back then! Yeah I
did do a lot of things at the very last semester, probably more than what we
had done collectively before that, but that just brings the pain to me: hey
what were you thinking?  
  
Honestly speaking, if I could live that life again, I would not anticipate too
much about any academic achievements. I would spend the time on doing things
that belong to my age, no matter what that could be. Filling my life with
stories would bring me the greatest satisfaction.  
  
Now I know I'm doing great, except for those flaw which is hard to avoid for a
man like me. But luckily, I know that except for my self-surveillance, there
will also be some guy who appear occasionally and point out to the north and
say: hey! Check it out! Something is happening over there! These random
factors are also important, which we can understand by guys who believe in
god, who always preach to us: god has a plan for you. Well no matter religious
or not, this happens and should never be neglected, in other words--luck, or
hope.  
  
Micah reminded me of the kind of person I should be. I am grateful that he
supports me during my difficult time. I can suffer the physical hardness
better than mental discomforts. With few people in interaction, I sometimes
would forget who I am, although in my mind I always know who I want to be.  
  
Got lots of homework this week. It is annoying that the pressure of looking
for an intern increases with homework. Tricky isn't it?  
  
Basketball game in a while, and BAAAAAAAAMMMMMM let the shitload of things
start!
