I'm starting over, after the wave of Toefl has passed, and the failure of
several attempts of my research. Everything ended at 9 p.m today, and starts
over towards a promising future, at least I hopefully think so.

CXX left today. She is nice. She called us to the lab and told us everything I
needed to continue the research during her days in Changsha, and she gave me
the key of our
warehouse![Starting Over](https://simg.sinajs.cn/blog7style/images/common/sg_trans.gif)

From tomorrow on, we will test our sample by western blotting everyday until
there is a ideal result. CXX sets us a mission of three protein before she
comes back, and said this would be a remarkable achievement if we could do it.
Well, I believe that we can, and I'll try.

Na is facing her Toefl this Saturday, I know it's not easy for her, especially
due to some mental reasons, anyway I hope she doesn't have too much burden and
just bring it on, everything will be
fine.![Starting Over](https://img.bimg.126.net/photo/_TwpGl8EIA63wt7fzl6vmw==/3178415437017517800.gif)
