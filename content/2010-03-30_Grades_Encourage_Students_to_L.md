As far as I can remember, I was measured from the very beginning of my
education by grades in China. As somewhat a victim of this system, I claim
that using grades to judge students would harm their confidence in study, and
might lead to a grade-based learning process where grades are the only
measurement for a student's success.

Before I start my support of my opinion I have to make a compromise. The
educational system of measuring by grades does have some positive effects on
students, especially for those who have strong hearts and determinations to
view the grading process totally as a game, in which they lose feeling
nothing, while win with a strong sense of achievement. I have some classmates
of this kind when I was in high school, and things just worked perfectly for
them. However, we cannot reasonably assume that grading system encourages all
students to learn.

Students are not all so confident like the minorities that I mentioned. A
considerable number of students are learning under the pressure from both
their parents and their teachers. To make the situation worse, some of the
students are not really having a great interest in the boring process of
studying all the day. Under these circumstances, when these students fail to
get a nice score and are criticized for this, problem happens, that they lose
confidence of competing with the winners for higher score. One of my
classmates was diagnosed with certain kinds of mental disease due to this
reason, and postpone his university education for one year.

Another important deficiency for the grading system is that, in most cases, it
leads the students into a grade-based education. The only thing they care
about becomes their score, because everyone will praise and envy them for that
reason. So in this way, students drop all their interests, and concentrate on
how to raise their score. Just take a look at how many students had learned
how to play a instrument, or drawing, singing and some other skills, and then
how many of them quit simply because they had no more time on those activities
because their competitors would be winning over them in scores in these time.
This system has made our education totally misleading, to a situation that
students graduates only with the ability to take examinations, however lacking
in the abilities to having gratitude to the wonderful world around us, which
is an equally vital part of one's education.

I would say it is so pathetic to entirely depend on grades to mark the
students. Students should be encouraged to learn through various methods, and
through excavating the potential in themselves, and that, in my view, would be
the essence of education.
