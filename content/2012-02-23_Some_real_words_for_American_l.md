What Amit told me today cause a real blizzard in me.

"In America if you don't speak for yourself, then nobody would."

Amit is an Indian post-doc now. He came to America 8 years ago.

As a typical science guy -- I mean a single Asian science guy, he is pretty
easy going. He can do a lot of work in one day, but keep the mild pace when he
talks to you. From him I do see that Asians share some common value, like
respecting your elder, your teachers, and the young. So this is the problem.

Amit said this was a lesson he learned from his previous professor when he
first came to US. I am grateful that I can learn this and get a chance to
perform it by myself within the first year of my stay in US. I will ask for my
pay as the professor agreed.

I believe there are several reasons for which I do not feel comfortable with
US life, and this now should be clearly identified as one of those. Knowing
that my temporary goal is to get a job and start my career here, I have to dig
all as many reasons as possible the sooner the better, and I definitely need
more people who can talk to me and share their wisdom.

And also another thing I want to mention -- From a certain perspective, I am
too naive compared to my friends here, but what can I do with that? Put myself
in a weird position and give it a shot? No way, not unless I think it's
appropriate. Screw those comments...

Indeed, it is not as fancy as what I, no, accurately it should be my friends,
had imagined before the August of 2011. As a master, I am loaded with a heavy
burden of supporting myself after graduation, fitting myself in the
environment, networking, and the unexpected challenge -- the fast changing
relationship among the Chinese student body.

Maybe this is the toughest time of my life, maybe not. I would prefer it's
not, which means that I will some day in the future know that, even physically
30 or 40 years in age, I still have the courage and willingness to go for
something as I was able to do when I was 20.

Willingness is also a issue I should be cautious about. In the business school
class I took, I self-identified myself as a "hub person", which undoubtedly
would be a good member of a team, but what I lack now is the power to take
control and to speak up. Maybe the expansion of traditional culture in me lead
to a less aggressive guy, but also the unwillingness of share my thoughts in
this hollow environment sucks my passion. But the good news is there is always
a chance to change. And the chance to change is often brought by the
environment that you are forced into-no matter voluntarily or by force. So the
trick is to place yourself where you know would be tough for your feeling but
good for your body and mind.

As what I read from the book "What I Talk About When I Talk About Running",
the marathon winner would also think it stupid and ignore the questioner when
asked about "whether it is enjoyable to run the whole trip" or "Is there a
time when you want to quit".

Maybe the treasure is placed at the gate of the hell. You go grab it and run
away, thought it might burn your feet. It's worth it.
