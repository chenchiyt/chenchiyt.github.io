Yesterday was a special day.

It was a typical 33+ years old day.

Waking up in the morning, breakfast at home, hand made coffee, and rode my
bike to work. Every Saturday I went pick up my son, try to create some memory
together, and send him home the following morning.

Last night I went to work out as always, about 2-3 times a week. This was some
new habit I tried to embrace since Feb. 2023. It was believed working out was
a must for people who work like us.

My girlfriend and I had good times, and everything looks still good for now,
it's good to have company, sharing more good times to come.

Writing these words feels a little bit funny to myself. Maybe I wirte much
less than before, especially in my 2nd language, this article looks like it
was written by an older man, very stable wording, truth-based, and calm.
Indeed I am one year older now.

Yesterday was my birthday, yet, a normal day, and that is why it should be
remembered. Be graceful for every day for the rest of my life.
