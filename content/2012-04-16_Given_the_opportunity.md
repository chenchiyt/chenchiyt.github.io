President of CSUE mentioned to me the opportunity to take over the position
next semester.  
  
And after some thinking, this is my conclusion:  
  
If some PhD student is keen in working as the president, I will not compete
with them, cuz by nature they should be better with this position because they
will stay longer which is better for the susceptibility; but if all the three
candidates are too weak and not willing to take this position, I might just go
and devote my effort.  
  
From my point of view, I am probably the best person considering only
personality. I'm social, I'm active, I have the sense of humor, and I am
better at English.The problem is my short history with this organization,and
my identity as a Master, who will leave in one year.  
  
Anyway, if people trust me with this position, I will take it. If it's not
this case, I will still be active on campus, maybe more MC, more basketball
game with undergrads.  
  
Life is short, experience it, enjoy it!
