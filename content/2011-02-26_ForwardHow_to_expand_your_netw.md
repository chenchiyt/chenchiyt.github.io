After I chose the MPH degree instead of PHD with money, I knew that I've
pushed myself to a total different world, for which I am an absolute beginner.
I wish that I will make up with my lost experience, especially in the skills
that will be very important for my potential career. What about try some of my
theory out in the journey 2days later?

Create a list of primary contacts. Your primary contacts are family members
and friends with whom you already have a relationship. Let these individuals
know about your career goals and ask them whether they know of anyone who
works in your target area and who might be helpful in your job search. The
names they provide you are known as your secondary contacts.  
Create new contacts. Start by getting in touch with the secondary contacts
referred to you by your family and friends. Be prepared to talk about your
career goals, skills and experiences. You may want to ask your secondary
contacts whether they would be willing to have an informational interview with
you. Another way of making new contacts is by joining a professional
association, attending conferences in your target field and doing volunteer
work.  
Make cold calls. Calling companies and organizations of interest and
attempting to meet with the person who has the decision-making power to hire
you, or with someone who is knowledgeable about the field, is a great way to
expand your network. If you are extremely uncomfortable making cold calls, you
can also write to the organization or company. However, networking by email is
much less effective than networking in person or over the phone.  
Conduct informational interviews. An informational interview involves meeting
with an individual in a field or occupation of interest for the purpose of
gaining current, regional and/or specialized information. They are a great way
of making new contacts and finding out more about the position, organization
and industry you are interested in. They can also help you explore
possibilities if you are in the process of choosing a major, narrowing down
career options or beginning a job hunt. The goal of an informational interview
is to probe your contact for information, not necessarily to ask about job
openings. If you are interested in conducting information interviews, review
the handouts section for tips and advice on how to get started, and ideas on
appropriate questions to ask.
