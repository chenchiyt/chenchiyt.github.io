7th,8th,9th](https://diaryofcc.lofter.com/post/1d40c559_73b297d)





There are three days to the tests and I think I still need to do something to
get prepared.

For every of these days, I need some articles to read and some listening to
practice.

For today and 7th, I concentrate on writing, read some nice articles and write
some myself.

On 8th, find that blog and check for updates.

On 9th, a little of every facet, reassure the strategies. Prepare ID,
student's ID, plan for the route.

Prabably there will be no mood in taking more of it, so try finish everything
on 8th.
