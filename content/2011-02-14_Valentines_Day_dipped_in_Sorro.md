Sorrow](https://diaryofcc.lofter.com/post/1d40c559_73b2946)





I logged in, I checked your blog, I saw nothing.

This was almost my routine for the past several months. I don't know why, but
probably because I am more of a practitioner, while you are always locked
inside your heart. I wanted to change everything, I tried hard, yet still I
fell.

From days to nights, from one city to another, I've been forced into this
thought, that I felt helpless and guilty everytime thinking of you. Yet these
days I got to understand, there's much inside me which is so hard to change,
like the unavoidable pressure you mentioned. Several close friends told me
that you'll live perhaps better without me, though the pure sorrow of losing
this relationship may cover every happiness for a while. But I do wish when
the clouds of sorrow vanish, sunshine will be sound and sweet, and you'll get
to know the real person as you are, and live the correct way as you wish.
Thank you so very much for being together with me for the four years, I think
I have no choice but to hide this pure and purest feeling deep inside, and
show to you only the pious blessing, for real. Hope that we both will cheer
up, and could still be friends, there's still something that we have to do
together.

Get up and have a rest!
